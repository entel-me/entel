# Contributing

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use Github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests on develop

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [git Flow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/gitflow-workflow)). We welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. Ensure the test suite passes.
4. Make sure your code lints.
5. Open a pull request!

After opening a pull request, write to a maintainer if you want to run your version under "real world" conditions. We're using a second environment ["entel-dev"](https://entelme-dev.herokuapp.com) to test the `develop` branch and pull requests separately to the [entel.me](https://entel.me) main environment.

## Any contributions you make will be under the GNU General Public License v2.0

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GNU General Public License v2.0](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-2.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/entel-me/entel/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/entel-me/entel/issues/new/choose) and choose the template _Report Bug_; it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Steps to reproduce (be specific and give sample code if you can)
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

People _love_ thorough bug reports. I'm not even kidding.

## Use a Consistent Coding Style

We're borrowing these from [BlitzJS](https://blitzjs.com), which automatically generated a code style for us.

- 2 spaces for indentation rather than tabs
- You can try running `npm run lint` for style unification
